These weights and biases are the trainable parameters of the network that can be \"learned\".\n",

For the image above, we have 9 neurons, with 32 connections (each with weight), 9 biases. This makes for 41 trainable parameters). This diagram is a fully connected network (each node connects to every node on the next layer).
